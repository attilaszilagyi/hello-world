Hello Friend,

My name is Attila, usually I code in C++ and C#, or rarely in VB.Net.

But these days I've started to extend my interests to web technologies. So I created some html5-css3-javascript websites and php-mysql portals with some custom joomla moduls also.

Oh, and I just finished a course on penetration testing to become a certified ethical hacker.

best wishes
attila
